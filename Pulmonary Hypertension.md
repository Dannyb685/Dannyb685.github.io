## Summary
- ![[4001.png]]

- **Symptoms**: insidious dyspnea, exertional chest pain, orthopnea, PND, edema
- **Exam**: JVD, increased P2, split S2, RV heave, TR murmur, hepatomegaly, ascites, edema
- **Signs of RV failure**: low cardiac output (hypotension, renal failure, hepatic congestion), arrhythmias, refractory hypoxemia (R→L shunt), effusions (pericardial > pleural)
- Most common reason for admission with a known diagnosis of pHTN is volume overload/RV failure and hypoxia
    - Consider etiology of decompensation: Progression of underlying disease, medication/dietary nonadherence, infection, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction/RV ischemia, shunting via opening a PFO as a release valve, pulmonary embolism
    - Goal of hospitalization is to understand and optimize hemodynamics
    - Overall goalimprove NYHA functional class, RV function, 6-minute walk test, quality of life
- General management: treat underlying cause, diuretics for right heart failure, goal SpO2>90%
## History & Physical
- Exertional dyspnea, fatigue, lower extremity edema
- JVD
- Hepatomegaly
- Ascites
- Edema
- Stigmata of liver failure
## Diagnosis
- Studies to consider ordering to determine etiology of pulmonary hypertension
    - Labs: BNP, liver enzymes, rheumatologic serologies (ANA w/ reflex ENA, RF/CCP, ANCA, Scl-70, Ro/LA)
    - EKG: R-axis deviation, RBBB, increased P wave in lead II
    - CXR: increased PA and R heart border, vascular pruning
    - TTE w bubble: RVSP >35-40, RV dilation and dysfunction, RA dilation, septal flattening, pericardial effusion, evaluate for L heart disease and shunt
    - PFT (outpatient): isolated decrease in DLCO in group I PH, TLC \< 50%, FEV/FVC \< 70%
    - V/Q scan or CTA chest to evaluate for CTEPH
    - 6-minute walk test is prognostic, can be used to monitor response to therapy
    - ± CT chest to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease
    - ± sleep study to evaluate for OSA
    - Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard test for PH diagnosis and determines pre-vs post-capillary HTN (See RHC section in Cardiology)  
        - Nitric oxide challenge to assess for drug response
        - Fluid challenge with 500cc LR to assess left heart compliance 

### CXR Abnormalities
- RA enlargement (obliteration of retrosternal space on lateral CXR)
- Prominent pulmonary vasculature (congestion)
- PA dilation
### CTA Chest Abnormalities
- Pulmonary artery > ascending aorta suggests PH
- Pulmonary artery diameter greater than 30 mm suggest PH
- Right heart enlargement

### ECHO Abnormalities
- Tricuspid valve regurg
- Estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) with echo
- Estimate right atrial pressure (RAP) with IVC diameter

- PAH medicines: Consult pulmonary hypertension if considering starting of changing meds
    
- Oral treatments may be used as monotherapy or in combination 
    
    - Calcium-channel blockers → patients with + vasoreactive challenge 
        
    - NO-cGMP enhancers: PDE5-inhibitors sildenafil or tadalafil, riociguat 
        
    - Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Bosentan, macitenatan, ambrisentan –
        
- Prostacyclin analogs
    
    - Prostacyclin analogs increase cAMP-mediated pulmonary vasodilation. Side effects include jaw pain, flushing, arthralgia, diarrhea.
        
    - IV formulations are administered through a continuous pump. Never stop IV prostacyclins, even brief pauses can cause rebound vasoconstriction and death. In an emergency, can run temporarily through PIV
        
        - Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan), half-life 4 minutes.
            
        - Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO, half-life 4 hours 
            
        - Iloprost: inhaled, half-life minutes 
            
        - Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours 
            
- Treatment based on NYHA functional classification: 
    
    - Class I: no treatment or monotherapy 
        
    - Class II: monotherapy or combination oral therapy 
        
    - Class III: combination oral therapy or prostacyclin 
        
    - Class IV: prostacyclin ± oral therapy 
        
- Lung transplant for patients who are candidates and failing maximal medical therapy 
    
- VA ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or lung transplant 
    
- Atrial septostomyserves as “pop-off” valve and allows for decompression of failing RV; used as definitive palliative procedure or bridge to transplant

### Prostacyclins

### Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) Inhibitors

### Endothelin receptor antagonists
