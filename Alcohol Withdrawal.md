# Alcohol Withdrawal

## Connections

- MD Calc - [PAWSS](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10102/prediction-alcohol-withdrawal-severity-scale)- "the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) was most useful, with an LR of 174 when patients had 4 or more individual findings and an LR of 0.07 when there were 3 or fewer findings."

## Summary  
- ![](4686.png)
- ==Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening. Those at risk for severe withdrawal (largely based on a known history of previous severe withdrawal) should have standing benzos ordered, otherwise order them PRN based on CIWA score.== 
	- It doesn't hurt to give IV thiamine if there is concern for Wernicke encephalopathy.
- Chronic changes of alcohol use may also include **cytopenias** and decreased renal tubule and GI absorption leading to **low K, Mag, Ca, Phos, and Vitamin D.**
- In patients with **liver disease**, the benzodiazepines **lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam** (*LOT*) are preferred due to their shorter half-life and lack of active metabolites.
	- A Way of Conceptualizing Benzodiazepines to Guide Clinical Use - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26554326
	- Benzodiazepines with longer half-lives and active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, place patients with hepatic dysfunction at risk for toxic drug buildup.

- Assess patient every two hours. 
	- Do your own CIWA, but nurses should be doing it too.


> [!Success] Pearls
> - Drinking is considered "risky" if >4 drinks/occasion or >14/week in men; >3/occasion or >7/week for women
> - Withdrawal is an imbalance of GABA and glutamate - when stop EtOH, GABA drops and excess glutamate leads to noradrenergic surge and symptoms
> - CIWA depends on interaction with patient; if AMS consider based on RAAS goals (HR and BP), though this is not validated
> - 5 C’s of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) - control, cravings, consequences, compulsion, cut back
> - Chronic changes of alcohol use - cytopenia, ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, decreased renal tubule and GI absorption leads to low K, Mag, Ca, Phos, VitD
> - Wernicke Encephalopathy causes oculomotor and cerebellar dysfunction, AMS, and dietary deficiency - give thiamine
> - Korsakoff - memory deficits (confabulation), apathy

## Sample A&P

**# Alcohol Withdrawal**

**Checklist  
-- ABC:** calculate PAWSS; does the patient need ICU for checks q1-2, CIWA >20, already in DTs, or concern about airway protection?**  
‍**-- **Chart Check**: prior admissions, seizures, intubations  
-- **HPI Intake:** quantity and type of EtOH, last drink, hx of seizure, ICU, intubation, DTs, hx patient-initiated discharge, other drug use  
-- **Can't Miss**: seizure, delirium tremens  
-- **Admission Orders:** CIWA at least q4  
-- **Initial Treatment to Consider:** give IV thiamine if c/f Wernicke's, D5LR if c/f ketoacidosis; decide on PRN vs standing benzos

**Assessment:**  
-- **History**: ***  quantity and type of EtOH, last drink, hx of seizure, ICU, intubation, DTs, hx patient-initiated discharge, other drug use  
-- **Clinical/Exam**: *** tremors, sweats, tachy, HTN, headache, anxiety, seizure, hallucinations (visual/tactile > auditory), DT’s is disorientation, hyperactivity, hallucinations  
-- **Data**: *** CBC, CMP, CK, UDS, serum EtOH  
  
The patient's HPI is notable for ***. Exam showed ***. Labwork and data were notable for ***. Taken together, the patient's presentation is most concerning for ***, with a differential including ***.

**Plan**:  
**_Workup_**  
-- Labs - CBC, CMP, CK, UDS, serum EtOH  
  
**_Treatment_**  
-- IV thiamine 200-500mg IV TID for 4-7 days if c/f Wernicke’s, D5LR if c/f ketoacidosis  
-- CIWA q2-4 with *** (PRN vs standing; benzo, phenobarb) protocol  
-- Folate 1mg daily, multivitamin daily  
-- Consider initiating naltrexone 25mg PO daily, acamprosate 666mg TID  
-- Recommend AA
