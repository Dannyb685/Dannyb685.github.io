> [!NOTE]- Toxic Ingestion Fast Tips
> - Poison Help line (**1-800-222-1222**)
> - Orthostatic hypotension resulting from mild peripheral vasodilation is common. However, persistent or severe hypotension should raise the suspicion of coingestants.
> - Obtain baseline studies, including a CBC with diff, BMP, LFT's, ABG, and CK (Creatine kinase level).
> - A 12 lead EKG should be obtained on all patients with intentional overdose, as there is always a possibility of cardiotoxic co-ingestants.
> - Chest x-ray is important to rule out any pulmonary edema or aspiration especially in a patient with an unprotected airway.
> - Naloxone should be given to patients with significant CNS and/or respiratory depression.
> - Continuous IV infusion of naloxone is very safe in patients who were not opioid dependent. However, in patients who are opioid dependent this practice is dangerous and may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
> - Activated charcoal should be administered to all patients with opiate intoxication following ingestion. Because of the delayed gastric emptying produced by opiate intoxication, it is effective even in patients who present late following ingestion. Orogastric lavage is indicated if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion.
> - All patients with significant respiratory depression, recurrent sedation should be observed in the hospital for at least a period of 12-24 hours. Most physicians admit the patients if they require a second dose of naloxone. Patients should have continuous cardio respiratory monitoring.
