- Asthma is a disease of inflammation of the airways that results in airway obstruction.
- Median age of onset = 4 years old
## Quick Quiz
- Characteristic **arterial blood gas findings** in **early asthma** include hypoxia and <b>respiratory alkalosis (increased ph, decreased PCO2).</b>
	- Asthmatics typically present with respiratory alkalosis because of <b>hyperventilation</b> when mild.
	- What about if the asthma attack is **severe** and continued?
		- <b>The arterial blood gas analysis may appear within reference ranges or demonstrate developing or worsening respiratory acidosis.</b>
			- Patient is exhausted from hyperventilating and there may be impending respiratory collapse.
- Prevalence? <b>5–10%</b> of the US population
- Categories of inhaled medications
	- Short-acting beta agonist (SABA): beta-2 agonism of <b>bronchial smooth muscle to achieve bronchodilation; also decrease mast cell mediator release.</b> Ex: albuterol, levalbuterol
	- Long-acting beta agonist (LABA): - beta-2 agonists, same as SABAs but <b>have lipophilic side chains that allow longer binding but also slow the onset of action.</b> Ex: formoterol, salmeterol, olodaterol
	- Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA): - <b>non-specific muscarinic receptor antagonists, leads to bronchodilation and reduced secretions.</b> Ex: tiotropium, umeclidinium, glycopyrrolate
	- Inahled corticosteroid (ICS): - <b>suppress airway inflammation.</b> Ex: budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone

## Classifications
- Asthma: a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory system characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, episodic exacerbation (asthma attacks), and reversible airflow obstruction; manifests with reversible cough, wheezing, and dyspnea
- Acute asthma exacerbation: a reversible worsening of the clinical features of asthma that develops over a short period of time and can progress to life-threatening asthma; may be the first manifestation of asthma in some patients
- Allergic asthma: the most common type of asthma; begins with intermittent symptoms in childhood and is usually associated with atopy (e.g., eczema, rhinitis) and a good response to treatment
- Nonallergic asthma: an uncommon type of asthma that is not related to atopy and is typically associated with a poor response to standard treatment (e.g., ICS)
- [[Asthma during pregnancy.]]

## Etiology

> Separate from intrinsic asthma vs extrinsic asthma
> Childhood exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of developing asthma.

### Intrinsic
- Allergies; **Atopy**: A genetic predisposition to produce IgE after antigen exposure. This leads to a tendency toward developing hypersensitivity reactions, especially allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma (atopic triad).
	- ![[Pasted image 20230426183738.png]]
### Extrinsic
- Viral respiratory tract infections (one of the most common stimuli, especially in children)
- Cold air
- Physical exertion (laughter, exercise-induced asthma)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): often exists concurrently with asthma
	- Asthma patients are three times more likely to have GERD.
- Chronic sinusitis or rhinitis
- Medication: aspirin/NSAIDS (aspirin-induced asthma), beta blockers
- Stress
- Irritant-induced asthma (e.g., from exposure to solvents, ozone, tobacco or wood smoke, cleaning agents, isocyanates)
## Pathophysiology
- Asthma is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airway mucosa, mucus hypersecretion/plugging, and airway edema, accompanied by bronchoconstriction.
## Signs and Symptoms

> Three most common symptoms:
> - Wheezing after trigger
> - Nighttime cough
> - Associated dyspnea

- Clinically, patients may present with [[Signs of Respiratory Distress]] or with more chronic symptoms.
- **Acute exacerbation** include cough, wheezing, tachypnea and dyspnea, with wheezing and diminished air exchange on chest exam. Although wheezing due to asthma is typically diffuse, focal wheeze may be heard in some settings such as mucus plugging.
	- Signs of a more **severe** exacerbation may include minimal air exchange and absence of wheezing due to poor airflow, cyanosis and [[Pulsus paradoxus]]
- **Chronic symptoms** include recurrent episodes of dyspnea and/or cough.
## Evaluation
- Ask about triggers: cold, exercise, URIs, allergens, inhaled irritants
- Ask about family history or personal history of atopy, eczema, allergic rhinitis
- Exam: wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase; nasal polyps, rhinitis, eczema
- Spirometry (PFT’s) with reversible obstruction
    - FEV1/FVC <0.7; FEV1 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator
- “All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma”. Must rule out alternative diagnoses:
    - Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction, foreign body, vocal cord dysfunction, CHF (cardiac asthma), COPD, ILD
- Consider CBC w/diff to screen for significant anemia and eosinophilia (associated w/allergic asthma or eosinophilic pneumonia)
- If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels

## Labs
- Characteristic arterial blood gas findings in early asthma include hypoxia and ==respiratory alkalosis (increased ph, decreased PCO2)==.
	- Asthmatics typically present with respiratory alkalosis because of ==hyperventilation== when mild.
- If severe, symptoms of respiratory distress will remain present (eg, shortness of breath, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, poor air movement, biphasic wheezing, accessory muscle use) and **the arterial blood gas analysis may appear within reference ranges or demonstrate developing or worsening respiratory acidosis.**

## Radiographic Findings
Chest x-ray findings in asthma include hyperinflation due to air trapping, increased interstitial markings and patchy atelectasis.

## Treatment

> [!quote] Tip!
> Ask about how often the patient is using their rescue inhaler each week, and how often they have nighttime awakenings per month. If the answer is more than 2 for either, their asthma is poorly controlled and you need to go up a step. Make sure patients are using their inhalers correctly! Ask them to show you!

- [[Alexander the Great's Little Tickle, The History of Asthma Management]]
- The primary goals of asthma therapy are to:
	- Reduce airway inflammation
	- Dilate the airways
- Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control. Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled for >3 months
- Prior to escalating therapy, consider:
    - Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses
    - Ensure patients receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect
- Updated Guidelines: prn ICS - LABA > prn SABA Step 1 (mild intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent)
    - Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed
    - SYGMA Trial showed rescue/prn Budesonide-formoterol (ICS - LABA) non-inferior to daily ICS-LABA + prn SABA in preventing exacerbations
- Follow-up
    - Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter
    - Regular follow up at least q6 mos for all patients with asthma
---
### Monitoring & Maintaince
> Long-term management of asthma involves a combination of treatment, close follow-up (every 1–6 months), and patient education.

- Choice of therapy for chronic asthma is based on the frequency, severity, and type of symptoms, as well as by other comorbidities.
	- Mild
		- Symptoms 2 or more times per week
	- Moderate
		- Daily symptoms; fequent exacerbations
	- Severe
		- Continual symptoms, frequent exacerbations, limited physical activity.
- Children with frequent symptoms are prescribed an ==inhaled corticosteroid== as a daily controller medication, with an inhaled beta-agonist such as albuterol as needed for breakthrough symptoms.
	- Can use B2-agonist prior to trigger exposure or exercise to minimize the asthma response
- Alternative and additional medications (such as montelukast) are also used under appropriate circumstances at older ages (> 4 years of age) as adjunctive therapy.
- **Anti-inflammatory agents -**
	- **Corticosteroids are the most potent**. Can use acutely (oral or IV prednisone, prednisolone) or inhaled forms for chronic therapy
	- Others: **cromolyn** and **nedocromil**. Become effective after 2-4 weeks, only good in 75% of patients

### Overview of Commonly Used Asthma Medications
- ![[Asthma - AMBOSS___2023-04-26 at 18.48.50@2x.png]]
- ![[Asthma - AMBOSS___2023-04-26 at 18.53.39@2x.png]]
- Albuterol 90 mcg/puff 2–4 puffs every 4–6 hours as needed
- Terbutaline 2.5–5 mg PO every 6–8 hours as needed
- Salmeterol DPI 50 mcg inhaled every 12 hours
- Formoterol DPI 12 mcg inhaled every 12 hours
- LOW: Adults: budesonide 180–600 mcg inhaled daily; children (5–11 years of age): budesonide 180–400 mcg inhaled daily
- MEDIUM: Adults: budesonide 600–1200 mcg inhaled daily; children (5–11 years of age): budesonide 400–800 mcg inhaled daily
- HIGH: Adults: budesonide > 1200 mcg inhaled daily; children (5–11 years of age): budesonide > 800 mcg inhaled daily
- Tiotropium bromide 2.5 mcg inhaled once daily
# Acute Asthma Exacerbation
## Summary
- Acute exacerbations are often triggered by an allergen (eg, smoke, pollen), exercise, or temperature change.
- The mainstays of treatment for an acute episode are anti-inflammatory therapy with ==corticosteroids (systemic dose of prednisone)== and bronchodilation with ==beta-2 agonists== such as albuterol, together with supportive care for hypoxemia or dehydration.
- May need IVF
- Get blood gas and monitor O2 sats
- If ph begins to fall or CO, begins to rise during an asthma exacerbation with ongoing respiratory distress, or if respiratory acidosis is identified, decompensation and a severe, life-threatening exacerbation may be occurring.
	- Dyspnea and hypoxia stimulate an increase in respiratory drive, which in turn leads to tachypnea or increased tidal volume; if the airway resistance remains low enough such that ventilation is not entirely compromised, hyperventilation occurs leading to respiratory alkalosis as acidic carbon dioxide is eliminated.
- ![[Admission Order Set Templates - Second Brain - Obsidian v1.0.3___2022-12-09 at 09.55.48@2x.png|Asthma Admission Order Set]]
## Evaluation
- Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts being admitted for inpatient management:
    - EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE)
    - CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis)
    - ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or lethargic/altered
- Dangerous signs and possible ICU if:
    - Tachypnea >30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing
    - Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could indicate impending respiratory failure)
    - Altered mental status
    - Requiring continuous nebulizers
## Treatment
- Continuous pulse ox with oxygen therapy to maintain O2 >92 %

- Continuous albuterol nebulizer or Duonebs until able to space to q1h>>q2h, etc

- Steroids with dosing based on severity of illness (there is no data behind exact dosing of steroids).

    - Start with IV methylpred 125mg q6h in severe exacerbation/ICU patients

    - Can start with oral prednisone 60mg q12h in less severe exacerbation/floor pts

    - Plan to transition from IV to PO and then likely to send pt home to finish course of 40-60 mg pred daily for 5-7 days.

- IV mag sulfate 4g over 20 minutes for severe exacerbation

- Keep pt NPO until off continuous nebs/respiratory effort is improved. Consider IV fluids with pt’s comorbidities (HFrEF, renal disease) vs. increased insensible losses with resp effort

- If pt is not responding to therapies, has worsening respiratory status, or blood gas concerning for respiratory acidosis needs ICU care for BiPAP vs mechanical ventilation

- Note: We do not start empiric antibiotics unless there is concern for bacterial infection


# Prognosis
Prognosis is generally good but is highly dependent on ongoing medical management and patient adherence to therapy.
