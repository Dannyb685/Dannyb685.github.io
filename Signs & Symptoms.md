# Unofficial Signs
- [[CHIMP Score]]
- **Positive cellphone sign**: They're in so little acute distress that they're casually browsing their phone
- **Casper the Ghost sign**: When you walk into a patient's room and their face/head is covered under the blanket - strong PPV for an underlying psychiatric disease 
- **Suitcase sign**: When a patient brings luggage to the ED (means they were wanting/seeking admission. They will never leave the hospital) 
- **Amateur pharmacist sign**: When a patient says something like "hydromorphone 2 mg IV q3h pain" (yes, a non- medically trained patient has said this to me, telling me what to order for their pain lmao) means 100% they are an addict seeking drugs.
- **O sign sleeping**, mouth looks like an O, reversible, positive prognostic indicator 
- **Q sign** - pt sleeping, tongue hanging out of mouth making a Q shape, irreversible, negative prognostic indicator 
- **Terminal lucidity** or 'the surge' is actually quite well documented. Patient declining has a 180 and then dies the next day. 
- **Hypernatremia in alzhemiers** patients means you are nearing the end of your life. The hypothalamus is an ancient and highly conserved structure across many species, if the thirst mechanism is gone the brain is in its final stages of life.
- **Teeth to tats ratio.** Inverse correlation with:
	1. Easily surviving something that we'd expect to debilitated most people 2. Self discharging in a spectacular fashion 3. Going from fine to suddenly being known to forensic pathology
- **The Ts of snakebites** (risk factors for being bitten by a snake) 
	1. Testosterone: more prevalent in males
	2. Teeth: fewer teeth, higher chance of being bitten 
	3. Tequila: alcohol of course 
	4. Tattoos: more tattoos equals more snakebites
	5. Trailer: lower socioeconomic status increases risk
