- [Interprofessional primary care practice including social workers: exploring the experiences of patients in vulnerable situations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13561820.2021.2015302)
	- The link between social inequality and health has been widely recognized, as there are systematic differences in health between people from lower and higher social classes. Furthermore, the complexity and multidimensionality of health and social problems has resulted in primary health care services that are increasingly integrating the approach of interprofessional collaboration between medical professionals and social workers. Despite this current focus, there is a lack of empirical insights into patientsâ€™ experience of the quality of care resulting from these collaborations. This paper aims to contribute to knowledge by adopting a research approach that captures the narratives of patients in vulnerable situations from a primary care center by conducting semi-structured interviews. Through content analysis, data was analyzed according to five themes: (1) availability, (2) accessibility, (3) affordability, (4) comprehensibility, and (5) usefulness. The results suggest a positive role for interprofessional collaboration between medical professionals and social workers within a primary health care setting. This includes the opportunity for giving greater attention to social rights and collaboration within the local community.
