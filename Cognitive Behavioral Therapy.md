## Patient Communication
We started to talk about the technique of "cognitive restructuring," which is effectively the process of "catching" an automatic thought (once an emotion arises), "checking" the automatic thought (through examining evidence for/against it), and "changing" such thought to become a bit wider in way (more balanced, adaptive, helpful, fair). 

I am pasting a series of questions that you could try out for practice; these are all ways to help us develop thinking patterns that can help mitigate anxiety and worry prompted by automatic thoughts.

As we talked about, try to incorporate asking these questions in situations where you find automatic thoughts resulting in emotions that are unpleasant. Today we talked about the emotions that can come up when thinking about your relationship. 

Not every question will apply to any given situation or thought, but I recommend that you hold onto this list and when you find your emotions stirred in an anxious direction, review these to see which may apply, and try to answer one or more that may be relevant/helpful. It's a skill that takes a little time to develop, but I've found that my patients find this to be helpful in advancing the skill!  
  
Let me know if any questions!  
  
All the best,  
  
Below is a list of questions and statements that help determine if the way you are thinking is accurate, helpful or consistent. The goal is to help you generate thoughts that help decrease the intensity and duration of the physical sensations and/or emotions you are having and help you better respond to what is happening. 

  
1. Am I upsetting myself unnecessarily? How can I see this another way?  
2. Is my thinking working for or against me? How could I view this in a less upsetting way?  
3. What am I demanding must happen? What do I want or prefer, rather than need?  
4. Am I making something too terrible? Is it really that awful? What would be so terrible about that?  
5. Am I labeling a person? What is the action that I don't like?  
6. What is untrue about my thoughts? How can I stick to the facts? What's the proof for what I am thinking?  
7. Am I using extreme, black-and-white language? What less extreme words might be more accurate?  
8. Am I "fortune telling" in a way that gets me upset or unhappy? What are the odds that it will really turn out the way I'm thinking or imagining?  
9. What are my options in this situation? How would I like to respond?  
10. Can I create more moderate, helpful, or realistic statements to replace the upsetting ones?  
11. Have I had any experiences that show that this thought might not be completely true?  
12. If my best friend had this thought, what would I tell them?  
13. If my best friend knew I was thinking this thought, what would they say to me? What evidence would they have that would suggest my thought is not completely true?  
14. Are there strengths in me or positives in the situation that I am ignoring? Am I underestimating my ability to cope with unfortunate circumstances?  
15. When I am not feeling this way, do I think about this situation any differently? How?  
16. Have I been in this type of situation before? What happened? What have I learned from prior experiences that could help me now?  
17. Five years from now, if I look back on this situation, will I look at it any differently? Will I focus on any different part of my experience?  
18. Am I blaming myself for something over which I do not have complete control?

Dear ______,

During our meeting, we talked further about the technique of "cognitive restructuring," which is effectively the process of "catching" an automatic thought (once an emotion arises), "checking" the automatic thought (through examining evidence for/against it), and "changing" such thought to become a bit wider in way (more balanced, adaptive, helpful, fair). This technique can be helpful for thoughts/emotions that arise with stressors of the day.

Here is a quick summary of a way to find and work with your thoughts (I'm putting a very simple example, unrelated to you, in parentheses just to illustrate the concept). You are already doing some of these pieces, but here are ways we can build from here!

Steps:

- In a stressful situation, find what is going through your mind. ("I was late today, everybody will think I'm irresponsible.")

- Label that thought ("I am mind-reading right now.")

- Find evidence for that thought ("Yes, I am late, and this probably shouldn't be a pattern)."

- Find evidence against that thought ("I have nothing to tell me that people think I am irresponsible, for a fact")

- Give this thought new meaning ("Sometimes things are out of my control and I run late, but this does not mean I am irresponsible as a person. My concern about being on time actually shows that I care about my job and doing things well. People may be more understanding of me than I am to myself, and in general I have a goal to perform well)."

- Ask: do your emotions change at all?

So putting it together for practice, below you'll find the prompts for the 5-column paper that we mentioned during our meeting. There is a piece of paper with 5 columns, and the capitalized headings below represent what you should jot down under each column for any given situation where you notice anxiety come on (or your mood worsen, in some way). 

I'm also attaching a PDF in case you'd like to print this exercise as well. 

Do let me know if any questions as you start to practice this!

Best,

THOUGHT RECORD 

Directions: When you notice your mood getting worse, ask yourself, "What's going through my mind right now?" and as soon as possible jot down the thought or mental image in the Automatic Thought Column. 

SITUATION 

1.       What actual event or stream of thoughts or recollections led to the unpleasant emotion? 

2.       What (if any) distressing physical sensations did you have? 

AUTOMATIC THOUGHT (S) 

1.   What thought(s) and/or images) went through your mind? 

2.   How much did you believe each one at the time? (0-100%) 

EMOTION (S) 

1.   What emotion(s) (sad, anxious, angry, etc.) did you feel at the time? 

2.   How intense (0-100%) was the emotion? 

Thought patterns to consider

1.         Black and White Thinking: Seeing things in all or-nothing terms: Either as totally good or totally bad. 

2.         Overgeneralizing: Seeing a negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat. 

3.         Negative Filtering: Seeing only the negative aspects of a situation while screening out the positive aspects. 

4.         Mind Reading: Assuming that others are (or will be) thinking about you negatively. 

5.         Fortune Telling: Predicting that events will turn out badly and that you won't be able to do anything about it. 

6.         Magnifying/Minimizing: Overvaluing negative information and undervaluing positive information. 

7.         Emotional Reasoning: Assuming that if you feel something is true, it must be true. 

8.         Shoulding:  Telling yourself that things should or must be a certain way (e.g., perfect) and it's terrible if they aren't. 

9.         Catastrophizing: Repeatedly imagining bad outcomes; thinking they're likely or that you couldn't stand it if they happen. 

10.       Personalizing: Placing 100% blame on one person (yourself or someone else) for a negative event that had many causes. 

ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE

1. 1. What cognitive distortion did you make?
2. 2. Generate a response to the automatic though. Considering the evidence for and against the thought, what is a realistic, balanced, fair thought?
3. 3. How much do you believe this restructured thought?

OUTCOME

1. 1. What emotion do you feel now?
2. 2. What will you do (or did you do)?
