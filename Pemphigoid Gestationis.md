The initial presentation of pemphigoid gestations, a pregnancy-related autoimmune disease, is typically abdominal pruritus. After the pruritus, a rash of urticarial papules and plaques that eventually form tense bulla develops around the umbilicus and trunk. The mucous membranes are characteristically spared.

The goal of treating [[Pemphigoid Gestationis]] during pregnancy is symptom control: relieving pruritus and limiting bulla formation. Pemphigoid gestationis typically responds to mid-potency to high-potency topical corticosteroids (eg, triamcinolone). Antihistamines (eg, loratadine, cetirizine) can also be added for pruritus relief. Disease that is unresponsive to topical corticosteroids may require systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) or, rarely, immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine, azathioprine). Intractable disease may be an indication for early-term delivery. Obstetric complications include prematurity, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal pemphigoid gestationis. Symptoms typically resolve spontaneously after delivery, but patients are at risk of recurrence with subsequent pregnancies.
