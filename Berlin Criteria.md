The Berlin Criteria, established in 2012, was a significant revision to the prior American-European Consensus Conference definitions. The main goal was to provide a clearer and more standardized approach for clinicians.

Here's a summary of the Berlin Criteria for ARDS:

Timing: The onset of symptoms should be within one week of a known clinical insult or worsening of respiratory symptoms.

Chest Imaging (usually a chest x-ray or CT scan): Bilateral opacities that are not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules.

Origin of Pulmonary Edema: The respiratory failure cannot be fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. An objective assessment (like an echocardiogram) might be needed if no risk factor for ARDS is present.

Oxygenation: The level of hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood) is used to classify the severity of ARDS based on the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio, which is the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen.

- **Mild ARDS**: P/F ratio ≤ 300 mmHg but > 200 mmHg
- **Moderate ARDS**: P/F ratio ≤ 200 mmHg but > 100 mmHg
- **Severe ARDS**: P/F ratio ≤ 100 mmHg

The criteria must be met with the patient receiving a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of at least 5 cm H2O.

The Berlin Criteria helps ensure that ARDS diagnoses are consistent across different clinical settings, allowing for better comparison of research, more consistent treatment approaches, and, ultimately, improved patient outcomes.
