**Title:** Binge-Drinking-Induced Nonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed in a Cirrhotic Patient: A Case Report

**Abstract:**

Excessive alcohol consumption is a global concern, with binge drinking being a significant contributor to alcohol-attributable deaths. We present a case of a cirrhotic patient with a history of alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis who experienced a nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed following a binge-drinking episode. This case highlights the importance of considering binge drinking as a risk factor for GI bleeding, especially in cirrhotic patients. It emphasizes the need for a comprehensive risk assessment beyond traditional scoring systems and calls for increased awareness of the consequences of binge drinking in the management of patients at risk for GI bleed.

**Introduction:**

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading global cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, with binge drinking responsible for a substantial portion of alcohol-attributable deaths. Among its complications, alcohol consumption is closely associated with the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. Scoring systems such as the Glasgow-Blatchford score and Rockall score are commonly employed to assess GI bleeding risk, with a score greater than 1 indicating the need for intervention or mortality risk.

This case report highlights a cirrhotic patient with a low-risk Rockall score and a high-risk Glasgow-Blatchford score who engaged in binge drinking, leading to acute hematemesis the day after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

**Introduction:**

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading global cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, with binge drinking responsible for a substantial portion of alcohol-attributable deaths. Among its complications, alcohol consumption is closely associated with the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. Scoring systems such as the Glasgow-Blatchford score and Rockall score are commonly employed to assess GI bleeding risk, with a score greater than 1 indicating the need for intervention or mortality risk.

This case report underscores the complexity of risk assessment in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding by introducing two critical scoring systems. The **Low-Risk Rockall Score** suggests that, according to the Rockall scoring system, the patient's risk of experiencing severe bleeding or adverse outcomes is comparatively low, potentially indicating a favorable prognosis that may not necessitate immediate and aggressive medical intervention. In contrast, the **High-Risk Glasgow-Blatchford Score** from the Glasgow-Blatchford scoring system implies an elevated risk of severe bleeding or adverse outcomes, urging immediate medical attention and possibly more assertive treatment strategies.

This striking disparity between these scores amplifies the intricacy of evaluating risk in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in those with underlying cirrhosis and a history of alcohol-related complications. It underscores the significance of considering multiple scoring systems and patient-specific factors to make informed clinical decisions.

**Case Presentation:**

A 47-year-old female with a history of alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis (MELD score: 29) and grade I esophageal and gastroduodenal varices presented with a large volume of hematemesis, one day after an EGD. Her admission labs revealed hemoglobin levels of 11.7 g/dL and platelets ranging from 30,000 to 50,000. She had a history of sobriety for ten years but returned to heavy alcohol consumption in the weeks leading up to her admission. Shortly after binge drinking the night following the EGD, she experienced multiple episodes of hematemesis.

A follow-up EGD revealed non-bleeding esophageal varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, two small oozing ulcers in the duodenal bulb and antrum, and an actively oozing vessel in a fundic ulcer, which was treated using hemoclips. Post-EGD treatment included initiating the patient on an Octreotide and Pantoprazole drip.

A 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis, characterized by a MELD score of 29 and grade I esophageal and gastroduodenal varices, presented with a severe and alarming medical complication. The patient's admission was prompted by a large volume of hematemesis, which occurred merely one day after undergoing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure.

Notably, the patient had exhibited a history of maintaining sobriety for a remarkable ten years, offering a glimmer of hope in her battle against alcohol-related complications. However, this period of abstinence was regrettably cut short in the weeks leading up to her hospital admission. The patient's abrupt return to heavy alcohol consumption in the days preceding her EGD set the stage for a critical medical event.

Intriguingly, the patient's clinical presentation challenged the conventional expectations set by commonly utilized scoring systems. Her Rockall score, often employed to assess the risk of GI bleeding and predict outcomes, indicated a low risk. However, the Glasgow-Blatchford score, which is renowned for its ability to assess risk and dictate outpatient or inpatient management, presented a starkly contrasting picture, flagging her as high risk.

This discrepancy between scoring systems added a layer of complexity to the case. While her Rockall score might have suggested a favorable prognosis, her Glasgow-Blatchford score, influenced by factors not considered by the former, warned of the impending danger. It was this high-risk Glasgow-Blatchford score that raised concerns and set the stage for a critical investigation into the patient's condition.

Despite the initial EGD revealing mild gastropathy and a reduction in the size of esophageal varices, the patient's precarious situation was exacerbated by a night of binge drinking following the procedure. The consequences of this behavior manifested with acute hematemesis, setting off a medical emergency that necessitated immediate intervention.

This case underscores the significance of considering not only traditional scoring systems but also patient-specific factors and recent behavioral changes, such as binge drinking, when evaluating the risk of GI bleeding in cirrhotic patients. It emphasizes the dynamic nature of risk assessment and highlights the vital role of thorough clinical evaluation in managing patients with complex medical histories.

Intricate and multifaceted, this case serves as a poignant reminder of the potential consequences of binge drinking in cirrhotic patients and the imperative need for a comprehensive approach to patient care that transcends the boundaries of scoring systems.
