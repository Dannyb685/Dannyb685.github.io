Saying poor interpersonal skills or professionalism means nothing if you aren’t specifying what. Dude may be arrogant but also oblivious. In giving negative feedback, it is more important to focus on **specific behaviors and describe instances**, rather than personality criticisms (which is very much what your blurb reads as). If it’s too personal, it comes off as petty, won’t be taken seriously, and frankly isn’t helpful.

Giving specific examples also prevents evaluators from falling into biased feedback, or evaluating how _they felt_ rather than how the student behaved. People aren’t couches; they shouldn’t be evaluated primarily on how they make others feel, or how others interpret their actions. I can’t control how you interpret what I’m doing, and vice-versa.

Better ways to frame constructive feedback:

1. During rounds, the student would interrupt the attending, residents, and students. Student could work on waiting 3 seconds until others have finished speaking before chiming in.
    
2. Student said <mean or disparaging thing> to other team member, which was non-malicious but hurtful.
    
3. When given feedback on X, student changed Y, but could continue to improve on Z. Alternatively, during week 2, student was told X and given Y and Z strategies for improvement. Over the next two weeks, these strategies were not implemented and student did not act on available feedback.
    
4. It’s clear that student’s go-getter attitude has enabled them to build an excellent CV and knowledge base. While these accomplishments are commendable, when student said XYZ, they put down others who did less research/got average exams scores/were less ambitious. Student could try to frame things in a positive light.
    
5. Student’s knowledge base was impressive. However, student often answered questions that we’re explicitly directed to other students. Student could improve by counting to five before answering questions or waiting until the question is explicitly directed to them. (NB: imo you shouldn’t criticize a student answering group directed questions. By directing them to the whole group, they are fair game to everyone, even someone that answers back-to-back. If someone is constantly answering, start directing questions to specific students or residents, not the group.)
    

As far as professionalism, you actually should identify legitimate deficits rather than swinging that word around like we all joke about here. Was student yelling, abusive, tardy, lying, refusing to do tasks, failing to finish notes/tasks, etc.
