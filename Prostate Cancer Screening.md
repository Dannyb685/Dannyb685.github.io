In addition to prostate cancer, several [benign](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045614&version=Patient&language=en) (not cancerous) conditions can cause a person’s PSA level to rise, particularly [prostatitis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000257216&version=Patient&language=en) (inflammation of the prostate) and [benign prostatic hyperplasia](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046509&version=Patient&language=en) (BPH) (enlargement of the prostate). There is no evidence that either condition leads to prostate cancer, but someone can have one or both of these conditions and develop prostate cancer as well.

## Is the PSA test recommended for prostate cancer screening?

Beginning around 2008, as more was learned about both the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening, a number of professional medical organizations began to caution against routine population screening with the PSA test. Most organizations recommend that individuals who are considering PSA screening first discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors. 

Some organizations do recommend that men who are at higher risk of prostate cancer begin PSA screening at age 40 or 45. These include Black men, men with [germline](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000460154&version=Patient&language=en) variants in _[BRCA2](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046742&version=Patient&language=en)_ (and to a lesser extent, in _[BRCA1](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046047&version=Patient&language=en)_), and men whose father or brother had prostate cancer.

In 2018, the United States Preventive Serves Task Force ([USPSTF](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000753860&version=Patient&language=en)) updated its [recommendation statement for prostate cancer screening](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening)[Exit Disclaimer](https://www.cancer.gov/policies/linking "Exit Disclaimer") from a “D” (not recommended) to a “C” (selectively offering PSA-based screening based on professional judgment and patient preferences) in men ages 55 to 69.  (The USPSTF continues to recommend against PSA screening for men 70 years and older.) The updated recommendation, which applies to the general population as well as those at increased risk due to race/ethnicity or [family history](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000302456&version=Patient&language=en), is as follows:

- For individuals ages 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before making the decision, a person should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and consider these in the context of their own values and preferences. 
- PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for individuals 70 years and older. 

Currently, [Medicare](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000640052&version=Patient&language=en) provides coverage for an annual PSA test for all Medicare-eligible individuals ages 50 and older. Many private insurers cover PSA screening as well.
