[[Point of Care Diagnostics]]



# [[POC Lab Test Street Med.pdf]]

**Pages 1:**
- The document discusses the challenges faced by over 550,000 Americans who are homeless each night.
- Homelessness is linked to higher rates of disability, disease, reduced access to care, and poorer prognoses.
- Homeless individuals often represent a significant proportion of emergency room patients, especially in urban areas.
- The document highlights the importance of laboratory diagnostics in primary care, especially for conditions like heart failure.
- The Street Medicine program at Keck School of Medicine of USC and the LACâ©’USC Medical Center provides care directly to the homeless in their environment.
- The program delivers care to patients in places where they feel most comfortable, such as tents, under bridges, or on the streets.

**Pages 2:**

- The Street Medicine program sees point-of-care testing (POCT) as essential to its delivery model.
- POCT provides real-time test results and is crucial for patients who have inconsistent access to food and water.
- The program's team consists of physicians, physician assistants, and a nurse trained as test operators.
- The desired menu of diagnostics needed for the program's practice includes urine dipstick, urine hCG, whole blood creatinine, whole blood electrolytes, whole blood glucose, and whole blood hemoglobin.
- The team's vehicle is equipped with a temperature-controlled cooler for reagents that require refrigeration.

**Pages 3:**

- The Street Medicine program is currently using glucose meters and plans to introduce other tests listed in the document.
- The program aims to expand its patient population and continue to monitor the needs and utilization of POCT in the field.
- The document also provides references to various studies and reports related to homelessness and health disparities.

**Point-of-Care Tests for Street Medicine:**
*For the Street Medicine program to effectively serve the homeless population, the following point-of-care tests are deemed essential:*
- Urine dipstick (macroscopic urinalysis)
- Urine hCG (pregnancy)
- Whole blood creatinine
- Whole blood electrolytes
- Whole blood glucose
- Whole blood hemoglobin

These tests were chosen based on their relevance to the health conditions commonly encountered in the homeless population and the practicality of administering them in a street medicine setting.

**Future Areas of Need:** The Street Medicine program is currently using glucose meters and is in the process of refining its procedures to introduce the other tests listed above. As the program evolves and seeks to expand its patient population, there will be a continuous effort to monitor the needs and utilization of point-of-care testing in the field to ensure that the most relevant and effective diagnostics are available to this vulnerable population.
