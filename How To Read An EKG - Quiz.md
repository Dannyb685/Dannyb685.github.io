- 1st step? <b>Calculate rate - how?</b> 
	- <b>By counting the big boxes between QRS peaks. Divide that number into 300.</b>

- 2nd step? <b>Calculate Axis - How?</b>
	- Look at lead <b>AVR, then leads 1 and 2. and compare direction of QRS peaks</b>
		- See this table for details:

- 3rd step <b>Look for P waves</b>
	- If no p-waves, it's probably <b>A-fib</b>
	- If p waves, it's probably sinus rhythm.
		- What if the rhythm is off?
			- Consider the following:
				- <b> Sinus PACs ; Multifocal atrial tachycardia ; and sinus rhythm w/ AV block </b>
		- How do you tell if the rhythm is abnormal?
			- The rhythm is either sinus rhythm or not sinus rhythm.
				- A sinus morphology is an upright P wave in lead II and biphasic (up and down) P wave in lead V1.
					- Sinus Tach or Sinus Brady depending on the heart rate
- 4th step is to check the QRS (normal is < 121ms)
	- QRS wide?
		- . <b> >120ms: Abnormal sequence of ventricular depolarization, or excessive ventricular mass. </b>
			- Probably means it's <b>BBB or Vtach.</b>
	- QRS narrow?
		- That means <b>it's coming from above the ventricles, and we need to check intervals.</b>

## Axis
- Normal: - 30o to + 90o
- Quick method: Leads I and II
- Normal Axis: Upright in I and II
- Left Axis Deviation: Upright in I, down in II
    - Causes: LVH, LBBB, Left anterior fascicular block, prior inferior MI
- Right Axis Deviation: Down in I, up in II
    - Causes: RVH, RBBB, Left posterior fascicular block, prior lateral MI, PE
