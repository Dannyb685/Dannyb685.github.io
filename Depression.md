## Summary
- Screen all patients with PHQ-2 (down/depressed and little interest in activities), and if they screen positive have them fill out PHQ-9 themselves. 
- Though always a shared decision, in mild cases, therapy and CBT alone can be effective. In moderate-severe cases you can discuss initiating a medicine earlier. 
- In general, start with escitalopram or sertraline - they tend to be more efficacious and have better tolerability profiles. 
	- Start low and titrate the medicine every 1-2 weeks based on side effect profile, noting that it will usually take at least 6 weeks for most medicines to see an effect.
	- Be mindful of discontinuation syndrome in paroxetine and venlafaxine. 
- In general, if patient is in remission of MDD, continue for 4-9 months. 
	- If they have had 3 or more episodes of MDD or a prior severe episode (SI or psychosis) continue for at least 1-3 years. 
- When tapering, do so over 6-8 weeks to decrease risk of relapse and prevent discontinuation syndrome.

> [!success] Pearls
> - Major Depressive Disorder is estimated to have a prevalence of 9% in the U.S; diagnosed based on specific criteria and present for at least 2 weeks
> - You can have depressive disorder that is not specifically MDD - due to a general medical condition like cancer, stroke, dementia, substance use like marijuana and alcohol, etc. 
> - Adjustment disorder - symptoms last less than 6 months following termination of the stressor
> - Women at higher risk
> - PHQ-2 is 97% sensitive for MDD if one or more are positive 
> - SIGECAPS (sleep disturbance, interest loss/anhedonia, guilt, lack of energy, concentration problems, appetite suppression, psychomotor retardation, suicidal ideation)
> - CBT - the focus is on behavioral and cognitive restructuring to change disruptive thought patterns
> - Meds and therapy together are superior to either alone, but all options are okay
> - Should consider depression as a cause of FTT/weight loss, fatigue, “pseudo” dementia
> - Discontinuation syndrome can happen in 20% of patients on SSRI for 4 weeks or longer who abruptly stop - flu-like sxs, nausea, insomnia, hyperarousal, sensory disturbances
> - Consider polysomnography if c/f underlying sleep disorder

### Sample A&Ps
#### Depression - Outpatient:
Major Depressive Disorder, *** (new/recurrent)
The patient meets criteria for a depressive episode based on PHQ9 score of *** and 4 or more SIGECAPS. Denies SI, HI, AVH. The patient's functional impairment is manifested by *** . No personal history of panic attacks, PTSD or manic episodes, significant famhx of bipolar, and no psychotic features. Etiology is multifactorial and includes component of *** . The patient does not have anemia, diabetes, untreated hypothyroidism, chronic infection such as HIV or HCV. They are not on medications (eg, AEDs, steroids, BZDs, BBs) or using substances that would better explain their symptoms. Previous treatments include *** (Include any past medications and their efficacy). 
- Diagnostic Workup:
	- TSH, CBC, BMP, HIV, and HCV tests to rule out secondary causes. 
	- Consider Utox, LFTs, HgbA1C, RPR
- Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions:
	- Continue/Referred for CBT
	- Encouraged regular aerobic exercise (30 mins/day for 5 days/week)
	- Mindfulness activities like biofeedback, yoga, and meditation.
- Pharmacological Interventions:
	- Consider starting with an SSRI like escitalopram or sertraline, and uptitrate as tolerated. 
		- escitalopram 5mg qd, increase to 10-20 mg qd as needed/tolerated
		- sertraline 50mg qd, uptitrate by 25-50mg qweekly as needed/tolerated (200mg qd max)
	- If the depression is recurrent, consider starting with previously effective medication or, if none, review medication shared decision-making aid: https://depressiondecisionaid.mayoclinic.org/
	- Consider alternative or additional medications in special circumstances: 
		- SNRIs for chronic pain
		- TCAs for chronic pain/migraines/insomnia
		- Bupropion to avoid weight gain or sexual side effects, or for smoking cessation. 
- For Resistant/Refractory Treatment:
	- If unresponsive to 2 therapeutic doses of antidepressant meds, trial an antidepressant from another class and augment with CBT. 
	- Refer to psychiatry, reassess for organic causes, and treat substance use disorder/personality disorder/history of trauma if present. 
	- Consider augmentation with bupropion/mirtazapine or atypical antipsychotic, T3 transcranial magnetic stimulation, referral for psychedelic assisted psychotherapy (legal options like ketamine or psychadellics as part of clinical trials), or electroconvulsive therapy.
- Follow-up:
	- In 4 weeks to evaluate treatment efficacy and adjust plan as necessary.

### Patient Guidance and Information

**Starting SSRI**

Based on your symptoms of depression, we will plan to start at the lowest dose and titrate up based on how you are feeling. Most initial side effects will improve over time with continued use. For this medicine, they may include ***.

We usually need at least 6-12 weeks at a full tolerable dose to assess if it is working or not for your mood. There are plenty of other options for us to try in the event that this medication does not seem to help. It's also important to recognize that in the future we can always trial weaning the medication off, even if it does seem to help.
