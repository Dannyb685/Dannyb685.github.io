Tourniquet-associated ischemia, and we get consulted for emergent fasciotomies for these far more often than I'd like.

Essentially, a tourniquet gets applied to a limb, and exceeds either the venous outflow pressure, or both venous outflow and arterial inflow. Once this happens, cell death starts. Muscle breakdown starts happening and all kinds of stuff gets released, like intracytoplasmic calcium and a shitton of potassium. The skin is very metabolically active, and it also starts dying - you get bullae formation, epidermolysis and slough, and underlying dermal necrosis.

When you release the tourniquet AFTER cell death has started, you get reperfusion syndrome, in which all of these highly active things get distributed to the nearby tissue and you get runaway cell death and a mind boggling amount of edema, which leads to compartment syndrome and always requires extensive fasciotomies and nerve release.

What you're describing, the demarcation line with bullae and crazy edema? Exactly consistent.
