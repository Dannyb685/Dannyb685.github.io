# ED
## Summary
- Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common issue defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity. 
- Normalize talking about sex and asking male patients about ED. The majority of care for ED patients can be done by PCP. 
- Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, and management of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea, can improve ED. 
- Other treatment options include medications like sildenafil or tadalafil, which are phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). 
	- Sildenafil, taken in doses of 50-100mg on an empty stomach one hour before sexual activity and is effective for up to four hours. 
		- Side effects of sildenafil may include headaches, dyspepsia, vasodilation, diarrhea, rhinitis, epistaxis, and visual disturbances.
		- Sildenafil needs to be taken on an empty stomach - guidance to take before dinner on date night, will last ~8 hours; sildenafil will not have increased potency for erections above 100mg, but will lead to more side effects - need to counsel patients not to take more than needed; these meds do not cause priapism despite the ads everyone sees; they will NOT get a spontaneous erection - still need to have stimulation; these drugs will not cause dependence and you may not need it forever
	- Tadalafil can be taken daily (5mg) or as needed (10-20mg) about one hour before sexual activity, and its effects last up to 36 hours. 
		- tadalafil is longer acting but same potency as sildenafil.
		- tadalafil is also approved for BPH - can help with both (better option then finasteride)
	- For psychogenic ED, trazodone (25-100mg daily) can be taken at bedtime. 
	- It is essential to avoid taking PDE5i with nitrates, as this may cause a significant drop in blood pressure. These medications require sexual stimulation to work and do not cause dependence. 
- If ED treatments are not effective, referral to a urologist may be necessary to discuss alternative options, such as vacuum pumps, injections, or penile implants. Remember that the severity of ED may correlate with the risk of cardiovascular events, so it is crucial to consider undiagnosed cardiac risk factors in these patients.
# Clinical Pearls
- Intake can be standardized using the SHIM (Standardized Health in Men) - [link](https://www.pcf.org/c/the-sexual-health-inventory-for-men-shim-questionnaire/)
- Testosterone reference range based on AM draw - variation more significant in young men
- Often not covered by insurance - options are [CostPlusDrugs](https://costplusdrugs.com/medications/sildenafilcitrate-20mg-tablet/) and [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/sildenafil), and patients can ask for the cash price which since sildenafil is generic isn’t always that bad
- The benefit of injections is no systemic symptoms
- L-Arginine supplementation can be considered if patients are interested in that realm
