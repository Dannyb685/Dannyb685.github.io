- [ ] Repro neoplasia (female and male tumors)
	- [ ] Granulosa cell tumor
- [ ] Endoderm is one of the three primary embryonic germ layers and composes the innermost layer of the early developing organism. Endoderm derivatives include the epithelial linings of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, biliary system, genitourinary tract, vagina, and middle ear. Organs that arise from the endoderm include the liver, parathyroid glands, thymus, pancreas, and the follicular and parafollicular cells of the thyroid. Surfactant secretion in the mature lung is achieved by type Il pneumocytes, a component of the respiratory epithelium. Defective differentiation of the endoderm in the embryonic lung bud would most likely result in impaired development of type Il pneumocytes and reduced secretion of surfactant.

- [ ] Membrane potential = ==summation of the end-plate potentials==
- [ ] Vit 
	- [ ] A 
	- [ ] C 
		- [ ] Vitamin C (Choice E) is found in fruits and vegetables and is necessary for collagen synthesis, iron absorption, immune function, and conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. Deficiency causes scurvy, which is characterized by swollen gums, bruising and poor wound healing, petechiae, perifollicular and subperiosteal hemorrhages, and short, fragile, curly hair.
	- [ ] B1
		- [ ] Vitamin B1 (thiamine) (Choice B) is a cofactor for several enzymes in glucose metabolism and adenosine triphosphate production, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Deficiency is characterized by Wernicke encephalopathy, a triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Wernicke encephalopathy is theoretically reversible with administration of high-dose thiamine; if untreated, it can progress to Korsakoff syndrome which is characterized by dementia, confabulation, hallucinations, and psychosis.
	- [ ] B2
		- [ ] Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) (Choice C) deficiency is characterized by inflammation and cracking of skin around the lips, mouth, and tongue. It is not associated with aminoaciduria or Hartnup disease.
	- [ ] B3
		- [ ] Treatment of Hartnup disease consists of both niacin supplementation (nicotinic acid) to correct vitamin B3 deficiency and replenishing the constant loss of amino acids with a high-protein diet. One of the most prominent side effects of niacin is facial flushing due to an increase in prostaglandin synthesis (leads to cutaneous vasodilation). Aspirin or ibuprofen, taken 30-60 minutes prior to administration of niacin, helps suppress prostaglandin production by inactivating cyclooxygenase.
	- [ ] B5
		- [ ] Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) (Choice D) deficiency is characterized by dermatitis, enteritis, alopecia, and adrenal insufficiency. It is not associated with aminoaciduria or Hartnup disease.
	- [ ] B6
		- [ ] Def: Isoniazid
	- [ ] B12
	- [ ] K
		- [ ] Gut bacteria produce about half of the vitamin K required by the body. Therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., macrolides) can deplete vitamin K stores in the body by destroying gut flora. Since vitamin K competes with warfarin for binding to the active site of vitamin K epoxide reductase, depletion of vitamin K would augment the effects of warfarin and further increase INR.

		- [x] Leuprolide pixorize
	- [x] Question on bartonella
		- [x] Cat scratch disease is caused by infection with the Gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacillus Bartonella henselae. Infection is acquired via scratches or bites from domestic or feral cats, may be localized or disseminated, but most commonly causes local lymphadenitis in the lymphatic drainage pattern of the scratch location. The most commonly involved lymph nodes are the axillary and cervical lymph nodes. Histologic examination shows necrotizing granulomas with stellate (star-shaped) abscesses. Multinucleated giant call may or may not be present. Oiner causes of vmohadentein children include viruses loo, adenovrus, respiratov, ynoytial virus, ninovinus, Erstein Bar Minus and suggests a site of inoculation, whereas viral infection would likely demonstrate no such lesion.
		- [x] Brucella melitensis (Choice B) is one of the species of Gram-negative coccobacilli that cause brucellosis, also known as undulant fever. The other species that infect humans are B abortus, B. canis, and B. suis. Brucellosis is commonly contracted by the consumption of unpasteurized milk and would not be expected to present with a draining punctum.

	- [ ] ABC123
- [ ] Bortezomib:
	- [ ] What is it used to treat? ==Multiple Myeloma==
	- [ ] What does it do? 
		- ==Proteasome inhibitors prevent antigen processing and presentation on class I MHC molecules, thereby blunting CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation.== While this is an effective strategy to treat multiple myeloma, it also makes patients more prone to infections, especially ==viral== infections.
		- [ ] Presentation of antigens to CD8+ T lymphocytes would be affected by the use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. 
		- [ ] Proteasomes are large proteases with numerous domains that are present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. They are made of a and ß subunits and have an extensive role in cell cycle regulation, but also in immune function. The caspase, chymotrypsin, and trypsinlike protease capabilities of this enzyme complex are also critical to their role as antigen processing centers; intracellular peptides are processed in the proteasome for presentation on class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Antigen-bound class I MHC molecules are recognized by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, so proteasome inhibitors blunt the response of CD8+ T lymphocytes by altering antigen presentation on the surface of MHC I molecules.
- [ ] Educational Objective: Complex II of the ETC, or succinate dehydrogenase, generates FADH2 via the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. The electrons from FADH2 then enter the ETC to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Deficiencies in complex I can cause severe neurological disease, such as ==Leigh== syndrome.
- [ ] Educational Objective: Ursodiol ==decreases the cholesterol content of bile== and thereby prevents the formation of cholesterol gallstones. It is considered second line therapy when compared to cholecystectomy in patients with cholelithiasis and biliary colic.

	- Work backwards from: the appropriate statistical measure is the **odds ratio (OR).**
- [ ] **Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD)** is inherited either de novo or in an autosomal dominant manner and presents with **bony dysplasia**. Diminution or absence of the clavicle permits abnormal movement of the shoulders anteriorly as seen in this patient. Additional symptoms include impaired skull development, often involving the frontal or parietal bones, the presence of Wormian (intrasutural) bones, supernumerary teeth, hypoplasia of the maxilla, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, and delayed ossification of the pubic symphysis. CBFA1 (core binding factor activity 1) gene may be mutated. This gene codes for a transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation. Membranous often found along the midline, is most commonly affected. The life expectancy of affected patients is generally normal, as is neurologic development.

- [ ] Androgen-binding protein (ABP) is produced by the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules via the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells in the interstitium adjacent to the seminiferous tubules, the production of which is regulated by of luteinizing hormone (LH). Once released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, ABP facilitates spermatogenesis by binding to testosterone, allowing this otherwise lipophilic hormone to concentrate in the lumen. Normal spermatogenesis requires high local concentrations of luminal testosterone.
- [x] Renal clearance is defined as the volume of plasma that is completely cleared of a given substance in a specified unit of time.

- Tumor lysis syndrome most commonly occurs following chemotherapy initiation for leukemia or lymphoma. The abrupt destruction of a large number of n tumor cells results in interstitial and serum release of their contents, manifesting as ==hyper==phosphatemia, ==hypo==calcemia, ==hyper==kalemia, and ==hyper==uricemia, the latter of which results in acute kidney injury and gout.
	- Urea, in contrast to uric acid, is soluble in water and is normally reabsorbed in the nephron, contributing to the hyperosmolar gradient surrounding the loop of Henle. Urea does not cause acute kidney injury or contribute to hyperuricemia.
	- [[MAlpxEpA - Uric acid stones are radiolucent stones that are secondary to gout or tumor lysis syndrome]]
- During vigorous exercise and times of increased metabolic demand of myocytes, there may be insufficient oxygen for aerobic respiration. Myocytes consequently depend on anaerobic respiration, which results in the regeneration of NAD* from NADH through the production of lactic acid. This increased sarcoplasmic acidity results in muscle pain and burning.
