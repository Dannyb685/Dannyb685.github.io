# Guide to Ventilators
## Reasons to Intubate
- AHypoxemicRF
- AHypercapnicRF
- Severely altered mental status (GCS< 8)
- Severe Acidemia
## Ventilator Basics
- A/C → Volume Control or Pressure Control
- TV, RR, PEEP, FiO2
	- ![[Recording 20230925191204.webm]]
		- TV & RR → Ventilation
		- PEEP, FiO2 → Oxygenation

## After Intubation
- Daily CXR
	- Make sure lines tubes are ok
	- ARDS progression
- Central Line, A-line, NG/OG tube
	- 
- FASTHUGS BID
	- feeding/fluids
	- analgesia
	- sedation
	- thromboprophylaxis
	- head of bed elevation
	- ulcer prophylaxis
	- glycemic control
	- spontaneous awakening and breathing trials
	- bowel regimens
	- indwelling catheters
	- de-escalation of antibiotics/delirium.
### Montioring
- PF ratio shows if oxygenation is improving over time
	- [[Berlin Criteria]]
- Ppeak < 40-45
- Pplateau < 30
- Driving pressure < 15

### Extubation
> Extubate agressively, some failed extubations means you're being appropriately aggressive. You don't want to keep people on ventillators too long so better to try fail early. You must consider tracheostomy around 10 days. 

- PAO2 = 55-80
- Decreased FiO2 until 60%, then decrease PEEP
- Daily SBTs, daily sedation holidays
	- PS 30 mins-1hr
	- T-piece trial - COPD, HF

> If COPD can extubate to BiPap
## Trials To Know
- #1 trial to know is **ARDSNet trial** which says → Low TV vent strategy of 6cc/kg because higher pressures cause barotrauma.
	- Also allows permissive hypercapnia of pH of 7.2
- #2 trial is the **PROSEVA trial** which says → proning improves outcomes when P:F <150
	- ![[High-Yield Guide To Ventilators In The ICU - YouTube___2023-09-25 at 19.27.51@2x.png]]
- #3 trial to know is the **ACURASYS trial** → Paralysis improves outcomes when P:F <150
	- Recent **ROSE trial** argues against this finding though. Still ensure adequate sedation
