- Avoid caffeine, cigarettes before measuring
- Etc. ![[Pasted image 20230906075103.jpg]]

### Evaluating For Treatment Resistent Hypertension
- Confirm Treatment Resistance Clinic BP >130/80 mm Hg and patient taking 3 or more antihypertensive agents (including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system [ACEI or ARB] and a diuretic) at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. 
- **Exclude Pseudoresistance** 
	- Confirm adherence to antihypertensive therapy 
	- Consider medications that may interfere with BP control.
		- Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents 
		-  Oral Contraceptives and Hormone Replacement 
		- Sympathomimetic Amines 
		- Immunosuppressive Agents 
		- Recombinant Human Erythropoietin 
		- Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors 
		- Cocaine
		- Amphetamines
		- Antidepressants
	- Assess for Secondary Hypertension
		- [[Spotlight Series - Unmet Needs in Hypertension Treatment Options- 20143 on Vimeo ___2023-04-20 at 11.58.09@2x.png|Primary aldosteronism]]
		- Renal parenchymal disease 
		- Renal artery stenosis 
		- Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma 
		- Cushing syndrome 
		- Obstructive sleep apnea 
		- Coarctation of the aorta 
		- Other endocrine causes
		- [[Secondary Causes of HTN - UWORLD.png]]
- Perform 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (if unavailable, use home BP monitoring) to exclude white-coat effect.
- Assess for target organ damage
	- Ocular - Funduscopic exam
	- Cardiac - LVH, CAD, 
		- ABI for eval of PAD (surrogate for diffuse atherosclerotic disease)
	- Renal - Proteinuria, GFR

> [!info] Patients with RH have:
> - Accurately measured BP 
> - BP above therapeutic goal despite concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive agents in different classes 
> 	- Long-acting CCB 
> 	- Renin-angiotensin system blocker 
> 		- ACE inhibitor
> 		- ARB
> 	- Diuretic
> - AND THEY DO NOT HAVE
> 	- White-coat effect
> 	- Medication nonadherence
> 	- Undiagnosed secondary htn

## Diagnostic
- Blood chemistry including K and creatinine
- Estimated GFR calculation
- Urinalysis
- Fasting lipid panel and glucose
- EKG, *annually*
	- LVH on ECG suggests HT has been longstanding
- Microalbuminuria (especially in diabetics)
- Thyroid Function

 *Additional workup for secondary HTN is not routinely done and is based strictly on clinical suspicion or abnormal laboratory studies

> [!tip]+
> - Besides an ECG, the initial evaluation of newly diagnosed hypertension should include a complete blood cell count, fasting serum glucose, lipid profile, [[TSH]] levels, serum [[electrolytes]], renal function tests (creatinine with eGFR), and urinalysis.
> - Renal ultrasonography is used to assess the size and structure of kidneys and should be performed if there is a suspicion of secondary hypertension due to a renal cause.

## Treatment of HTN
### Inpatient Treatment

- ![[Pasted image 20230709191437.png]]
#### Malignant HTN aka Hypertensive Emergency
 ![[Malignant HTN - My Handwritten Note.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20230320225354.png]]
### Outpatient Treatment
- Hypertension is one of the most common outpatient condiditions you will manage. Unless severely high, elevated blood pressure does not usually cause any symptoms, but over time can lead to damage of the blood vessels.
	- This is why high blood pressure is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. 
- Most cases are from essential hypertension, but patients with severely elevated BP or those who are resistant to initial treatments should be worked up for secondary hypertension which can be caused by medications, OSA, renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism, and other rare tumors. **Anyone who has secondary htn needs a referral**
- Proper blood pressure reading includes sitting quietly for 5 minutes, arm supported at heart-level, using a properly sized cuff over the patient's bare arm.
- Lifestyle modifications include weight loss, exercise (moderate activity for 40 minutes 3-4 times per week), the DASH diet, reducing salt, caffeine, and alcohol intake, and quitting smoking. 
- Medications should be considered if BP >140/90 or >130/80 with other risk factors (ASCVD >10%). 
	- Start 1 drug if <150/90, 2 if >150/90. 
	- First Line treatments include calcium channel blockers, ACE/ARBs, and thiazides. 
	- Second Line treatments include beta blockers, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate, clonidine, and alpha blockers.
#### When to Initiate Outpatient Behavioral and Pharmacologic Therapy
- ![[Hypertension - Second Brain - Obsidian v1.0.3___2022-12-09 at 23.19.05@2x.png]]
- ![[UWorld USMLE ___2023-09-24 at 19.18.55@2x.png]]
#### Medication Choices
- General Adult Population
	- The meta-analysis conducted for the guidelines found a slight preference for thiazides (particularly chlorthalidone) as the first choice.
- Patient with [[Coronary Artery Disease|CAD]]
	- [[ACEI]]
	- [[CCB]]
- Patients with [[Diabetes|DM]]
	- [[ACEI]]
- Patients with [[CKD]]
	- [[ACEI]] or ARB (not in combination) +
	- Thiazide +/-
	- [[CCB]]
- Post [[Coronary Syndromes|MI]]
	- B-blockers
	- [[ACEI]]
- Patient with [[Heart Failure|CHF]]
	- ACEI/ARB
	- B-blockers
	- Diuretics
	- Aldosterone antagonist
- African American
	- Chlorthalidone is a preferred first-line drug for African American patients with isolated hypertension. Amlodipine is also a fair choice. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/E4dEd9F.png)
![[Pasted image 20230709211818.png]]

- Preferred combinations 
	- ACEi/ARB + CCB 
	- ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide. 
	- ACEi/ARB + CCB + MRA 
	- Do not combine beta-blockers with non-dihydropyridines.
#### Monitoring
- If starting Thiazide or ACE/ARB, reassess in 1 month with nurse visit
	- Compliance? Intensify therapy if still not at goal
- Then at 3 and 6 months.

- **What's a good treatment goal?**
	- Goal is typically < 130-140 / 80-90
		- Tailor to patient 
		- Normalize slowly per patient toward tighter goals if comfortable
		- Relax a bit for elderly
			- No long term benefit, 10 year risk reduction
			- Risk of AKI, electrolyte abnormalities, falls
				- [[SPRINT - Trial]]
#### Barriers to Treatment
- ![[Addressing barriers to adherence to antihypertensive therapy.png]]
- Medication nonadherence may account for >40% of cases of uncontrolled hypertension. 
	- If a patient shows an initial improvement in BP after initiation of medicine, followed by a return to stage II hypertension after a period of poor follow-up; this suggests medication nonadherence. Because there is often misunderstanding about a prescribed antihypertensive regimen, such patients should be questioned about medication adherence and provided education about hypertension treatment goals prior to additional diagnostic testing or treatment changes.
#### Treatment Resistent Hypertension
- ![[Screen Shot 2022-04-26 at 7.54.56 PM.png]]
- DASH Diet, optimize triple drug regimen (Long-acting CCB, Renin-angiotensin system blocker, ACE inhibitor/ARB, Diuretic)
	- The antihypertensives should be maximally dosed, work via different mechanisms, and include a diuretic.
- Then, add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone or eplerenone.
	- ![[Spotlight Series - Unmet Needs in Hypertension Treatment Options- 20143 on Vimeo ___2023-04-20 at 17.07.09@2x.png|PATHWAY-2 Trial]]
- If still not at goal after four drugs...
	- Check heart rate: unless <70 beats/min, add Beta blocker (eg, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol) or combined a-B-blocker (eg, labetalol, carvedilol). 
		- If Beta blocker is contraindicated, consider central a-agonist (ie, clonidine patch weekly or guanfacine at bedtime). 
			- Dangerous meds / combo. 
			- If these are not tolerated, consider once-daily diltiazem.
- If still not at goal after five drugs...
	- Add hydralazine@@@ 25 mg three times daily and titrate upward to max dose; in patients with congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hydralazine should be administered on background isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily (max dose 90 mg daily).
	- Or substitute minoxidil 2.5mg 2-3 times daily for hydralazine and titrate upwards. 

#### Patient Education & Guidance

**General Info**

High blood pressure affects almost half the population in the United States. Unless severely high, elevated blood pressure does not usually cause any symptoms, but over time can lead to damage in the blood vessels. This is why high blood pressure is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.

Treatment is based around loweing blood pressure to reduce the long-term risk of developing the above diseases. All patients with high blood pressure should consider lifestyle changes including diet (lower salt, alcohol, caffiene intake), exercise/weight loss, and quitting smoking. However, despite our best intentions, many patients will need to take medicines that can help lower their blood pressure.


**Lifestyle Changes**

Hello @@@  You have high blood pressure, also called hypertension. Lifestyle changes that can help lower blood pressure include weight loss, exercise (moderate activity for 40 minutes 3-4 times per week), the DASH diet, reducing salt, caffeine, and alcohol intake, and quitting smoking.

**Taking Blood Pressure at Home**

We would like you to monitor your blood pressure at home. Steps to most accurately record your blood pressure:

Take it at the same time each day.
Ideal times are after waking up and urinating, and before bedtime.
Sit in a quiet space without talking for 5 minutes.
Keep your back supported and feet on the floor. Do not cross your legs.
Place your arm on an armrest or side-table at the level of your heart, and keep it loose (don't squeeze your muscles).
Put the cuff over your bare arm, not over clothing.
Ensure you are using an appropriately sized cuff (if too small, it can make your pressure seem higher)
Record your blood pressure twice, and use the lower number.
Write the number down in a journal or on your phone.
Here is a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/gUHALsLeeoM) that includes some of these tips for your reference.

**Starting Medication**

To help control your blood pressure, we'd like to start a new medication called ***.

Please take @@@  mg, @@@

We will plan to have you back in clinic in *** 2-4 weeks to recheck your blood pressure and check labwork. At that time, we may decide to increase the dosage.

Side effects of this medicine can include @@@  Please let us know if you develop any of these symptoms.

‍

Amlodipine - pedal edema, nausea, flushing

ACE - dry cough, angioedema, prerenal AKI

ARB - prerenal AKI

Thiazide - urgency, electrolyte derangements
