- Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate

1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a simple, inexpensive laboratory test that serves as a general "sickness index" in conjunction with the patient's clinical history and physical examination findings.

2. The ESR measures the the distance that erythrocytes have fallen after one hour in a vertical column of anticoagulated blood under the influence of gravity

3. The ESR depends on the balance between factors promoting sedimentation and factors hindering sedimentation.
4. The major factor promoting sedimentation is aggregation of red blood cells and formation of [[rouleaux]].
5. Rouleaux formation is determined by the bridging forces of macromolecules (especially fibrinogen and [[01. Topic Notes/Topic Notes - Index Wikis/Immunoglobulins|immunoglobulin]]) and characteristics of red cells (number, size and shape).

7. Normal ESR is higher in women and increases with age. It is commonly defined in men as age in years divided by 2 and for women, age in years plus 10.
