## Quick Quiz
- Patients 40–75 years of age with [[diabetes]] mellitus get a <b>moderate-intensity statin</b>
- Patients 20–75 years of age and LDL ≥ <b>190</b> mg/dL: **high-intensity statin therapy**
- Very high cholesterol levels at a young age in the absence of secondary causes lead one to suspect <b>familial hypercholesterolemia</b>
- A 35-year-old man with no history of cardiac or other vascular disease asks how often he should have routine cholesterol screening? <b>Every five years</b>
- If treatment goals are not reached with maximally tolerated [statin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Zf129c33946d036ad0b7fa897aac6fd20) treatment, consider adding [ezetimibe](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Ym0nVg#Z885611662451f12696bce2563e024972). If goals are still not reached, a [bile](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Q60ukS#Z4d90dfc94eec0585c748e9b6c6899d95)-acid sequestrant or [PCSK9 inhibitor](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Ym0nVg#Z7511153d947717534002415b26f25968) may be added.

## Summary

> [!check] Dyslipidemia -> Go check ASCVD Risk (>7.5%? If they're old, it's going to be high)
> - LDL is main concern. Triglycerides and sugar tend to go together
> - Everyone w/ diabetes, cardiovascular dz, or LDL >190 definitely get statin

- Dyslipidemia: an abnormal concentration of lipids in the blood (e.g., high [LDL](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Zbb13b68a7df6923c5e64b205eaf78aa2), low [HDL](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Z27e8962e0f8aad298a35f52eabecdcdf))
- Hyperlipidemia: elevated blood lipid levels (total [cholesterol](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Ze08bc636c83ae44d6c771f5646271b57), [LDL](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Zbb13b68a7df6923c5e64b205eaf78aa2), [triglycerides](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Z2bfd946a638ffba7c38eda3282c46859))
- Hypercholesterolemia: total [cholesterol](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Ze08bc636c83ae44d6c771f5646271b57) > 200 mg/dL
- Hypertriglyceridemia: [triglyceride](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Z2bfd946a638ffba7c38eda3282c46859) levels > 150 mg/dL
- Hyperlipoproteinemia: elevated levels of certain [lipoproteins](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/1p02oS#Za6c680cea324b39057fe4a333986a9b0)


> [!success] If you remember nothing else
> Addressing hyperlipidemia is about playing the long game and reducing life-time risk of having a cardiovascular event, namely macrovascular ACS/MI. The ASCVD risk is largely driven by age and thus many patients will end up on statins in their 50's and beyond. You should risk stratify to determine which statin to use and precribe additional medications if the patient is not at goal despite lifestlye changes and statin use.

## Complications
- Complications if untreated: Development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, including coronary heart disease (CHD).
## Resources
## History & Physical
- BMI
- Carotid bruit?
- Peripheral pulses
- Xanthoma ; xanthelasma
- Corneal arcus
## Diagnosis
- Screening:
	- No specific screening frequency is defined. Usually:
	- Once at every first clinic visit regardless the age:
		- Some clinicians start screening
			- ♂ >35 y
			- ♀ >40 y
	- If risk factors for [[Coronary Artery Disease|CAD]] then ♂/♀ >20 y
	- ✓ q5y if TC <200, more frequently if RFs or approaching tx threshold
	- Adolescents and young adults:
		-  "A 2016 report of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, after review of the available literature, concluded that data were insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening in infants, children, adolescents, or young adults [[20](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-and-adolescents-definition-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/20)]." - Kiana's brother on 12/16/22
- Labs to order:
	- Initial
		- TC, HDL, LDL
			- Fasting is unnecessary (2-10% variation)
			- Can subtract about 25mg/dc in triglycerides to get estimate
			- Can subtract about 5-10mg/dc from LDL to get estimate
		- [[TSH]]
			- [[Hypothyroidism and Lipid Abnormalities]]
		- BUN/Cr
		- U/A (nephrotic syndrome)
		- A1c
	- Monitoring
		- Check 4-12wk after starting meds, changing regimen, or until goal reached
			- d/c if CK >10x or LFTs 3x ULN
		- Then in 3-12 months.
		- Afterwards, calculate CV risk and repeat if clinically indicated.
			- http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/
- Interpreting results:
	- Moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia is generally a factor that favors statin therapy.

### DDx

> - Secondary causes of HLD are most commonly hypothyroidism, diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds (thiazides, antipsychotics, steroids), alcohol use, and liver disease


- Idiopathic
- Diabetes mellitus
- Alcohol Abuse.
- Hypothyroidism
- Nephrotic syndrome
- Chronic kidney disease
- Obstructive (cholestatic) liver disease
- Anorexia nervosa
- Cushing’s syndrome
- Familial, eg, familial hypercholesterolemia
- Obesity
- Smoking – smoking decreases HDL and causes insulin resistance.
- Medications: thiazides (short-term effect), beta-blockers (short-term effect), oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, cyclosporine
## Treatment
### Who Gets Hyperlipidemia Primary & Secondary Prevention
- [Mayo Clinic Calculator Statin Decision Making Tool](https://statindecisionaid.mayoclinic.org/)
- ![[Pocket Primary Care - 2018  PDF  Relative Risk  Vaccines___2022-12-10 at 14.08.12@2x.png]]

- **Primary Prevention:**
	- Go By ASCVD, Presence of DM, or LDL level
	- Also consider Risk Enhancers:
		- HIV, CKD, Inflammatory diseases, LDL >160, and more. to create a comprehensive clinical picture of the patient.
	  - Super detailed version from AHA:
		- In patients with clinical ASCVD, reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with high-intensity statin therapy or maximally tolerated statin therapy.
		    - In very high-risk ASCVD, use a LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to consider addition of nonstatins to statin therapy.
		    - In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%, start a moderate-intensity statin if a discussion of treatment options favors statin therapy.
		- In patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL [≥4.9 mmol/L]), without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk, begin high-intensity statin therapy.
		- In patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), start moderate-intensity statin therapy without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk.
		- In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and 10-year risk of 7.5% to 19.9% (intermediate risk), risk-enhancing factors favor initiation of statin therapy
		- In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (≥1.8-4.9 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5% to 19.9%, if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain, consider measuring CAC.
- **Secondary Prevention**:
	- CAD, PAD, Ischemic Stroke all get high intensity statin.

> [!tip]
> - Continuing statin therapy after the age of 75 is reasonable if it is tolerated by the patient.

### What to Treat With
- **Lifestyle**
	- Every 2% wt loss is 6% reduction in LDL
	- Improving diet and decrease LDL by 13%
		- Vegetarian Diet: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807597
- **Statins**
	- High Intensity (30-50% LDL reduction expected)
		- [Atorvastatin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Zb1b70d571ca8551bd60274b2d7f34d8d) 40–80 mg PO once daily
			- Preferred in [[CKD]]
		- [Rosuvastatin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Z1331f787bec1d9fda42cc23420a27c63), 20–40 mg PO once daily
	- Moderate Intensity (30%+ LDL reduction expected)
		- [Atorvastatin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Zb1b70d571ca8551bd60274b2d7f34d8d) 10–20 mg PO once daily
		- [Rosuvastatin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Z1331f787bec1d9fda42cc23420a27c63) 5–10 mg PO once daily
		- [Simvastatin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Zbfaf5510bdc90b7a6901ce646d0bea3a) 20-40 mg PO once daily
			- Take in evening
			- Don't coprescribe with amlodipine
			- Increased myopathy risk
		- Pravastatin is ok in liver disease and with [[warfarin]]
			- Take in evening
	- Low Intensity (<30% LDL reduction expected)
		- [Simvastatin](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/am0QVg#Zbfaf5510bdc90b7a6901ce646d0bea3a) 10 mg PO once daily
			- Same as above
	- Statins metabolized by [CYP3A4](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/7N04cg#Z4faf3fcea7dfdabc74bca38e8f7f6268) (Simvastatin and atorvastatin) must not be combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors (azoles, [[macrolides]], protease inhibitors), since doing so increases statin concentrations and, thus, the risk of rhabdomyolysis.
		- ALSO don't prescribe with digoxin and [[warfarin]]
- **If Statins and Lifestyle aren't making a dent**:
	- Ezetimbe
	- Then PCSK9 monoclonal antibody injection or PCSK9 q6 month Injections

> [!warning] Maintain a high index of suspicion for rhabdomyolysis if muscle pain occurs after administering statins.
> - Some say treatment must be discontinued if myopathy occurs. #unresolved
> - Others say it's bothersome but can be managed w/ reassurance & exercise.
> 	- Placebo effect may contribute ~25% reported w/ placebo in recent trial JAMA 2016
> - Myopathy usually presents as a symmetrical (bilateral) condition that affects the large proximal muscles, particularly of the lower extremities.
> - Occur at rest or shortly after exercise & usually within 1 month of initiation of therapy or an increase in dose.

### Hypertriglyeridemia Treatment
> [!Tip] You may see pseudohyponatremia in hypertriglyceridemia

- They might have just not been fasting for the lipid panel
- Screen patients with high triglycerides for metabolic syndrome.
	- BGL control is key to decrease TG
- We usually don't treat unless fasting triglycerides >500, but we will treat at that point to avoid acute pancreatitis.
	- Statins should work to reduce triglycerides
	- Fenofibrate if they're on a statin already
	- Gemfibrozil doesn't play well with statins
	- Omega 3 okay as well but not significant
- ![[Lipid disorders - AMBOSS___2022-12-10 at 13.57.19@2x.png]]



## Monitoring
- Good to get a baseline LFT but no need to repeat monitor anymore on statins
- Research is curreently showing lower LDL is generally better. 
	- High risk patients should be around LDL of 55 even! 
	- 
- After starting a statin, recheck in a month or three. 
	- Statins work quickly but it's no rush to recheck.
- If patients aren't adherent, can take a harm reduction approach. 
	- Smallest dose possible, occasional dosing, whatever they will do to take just a little bit
	- Can try red rice extract if they're into herbal stuff
## Sample A&P

Lifestyle changes:
- Heart Healthy Diet: ↓ trans/saturated fats, choose skim milk, low-fat dairy products
- Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts and olive oil, while limiting red and processed meats, sodium and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages
- Promote a healthy weight, regular exercise, smoking cessation, limit EtOH

**Hyperlipidemia**

Current LDL: ***

At Goal?: ***

ASCVD Risk: ***

**Indications for Statin**‍

-- ASCVD (h/o CAD, stroke/TIA, ACS, PAD, h/o revascularization) - high-intensity

-- LDL >190 (followed by ) - high-intensity

-- Diabetes (age 40-75) - moderate-intensity

-- Age 40-75 based on ASCVD risk 

- <5% risk - lifestyle changes only
- 5.0-7.5% risk - mod-intesity statin
- 7.5-19.5% risk - statin goal 30% reduction in LDL
- >20% risk - statin goal 50% reduction in LDL

**Plan:** 

-- **Statin:** ***

- High intensity - atorva 40-80mg; rosuva 20-40mg
- Moderate intensity - atorva 10-20, rosuva 5-10, simva 20-40, prava 40-80
- Low intensity - simva 10, prava 10-20
- Rosuva and atorva are most potent, atorva safe in CKD, prava safe in cirrhosis, prava best to avoid myopathy, prava and rosuva least side effects overall

-- Add Ezetimibe or PCSK9 if LDL still >100 after statin or statin intolerance

**-- Lifestyle:** weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, limit EtOH, vegetarian diet

-- **Workup**: f/u LFTs before starting statin; consider sending A1c, U/A, BMP**‍**

-- **Monitoring**: Assess LDL q3-12 months ***

-- **Refer:** if c/f FHx or considering initiation of PCSK9i (LDL >90 even with statin and ezetimibe and high risk factors)

### Patient Guidance and Information

**New Diagnosis - Lifestyle Changes**

Our labwork suggests you have elevated ***. We call this hyperlipidemia ***.

Other ways to lower cholesterol include lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet, low saturated and trans fat diet, weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, and limiting alcohol intake. 

You can learn more about such lifestyle changes [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/reduce-cholesterol/art-20045935).
