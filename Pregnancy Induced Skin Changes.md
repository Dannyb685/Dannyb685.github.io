Pregnancy-induced pruritus is a common, benign condition that typically presents with localized, focal pruritus over the abdomen without an underlying primary skin lesion. Scratching can cause secondary, linear excoriations. Treatment options include oatmeal baths, ultraviolet light exposure, and antihistamines.
