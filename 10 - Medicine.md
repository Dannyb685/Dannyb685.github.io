> it is critically important to remember two key principles: first, the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and, when it occurs, to diagnose it early and provide effective treatment; and second a trusting relationship between physician and patient lies at the heart of effective patient care.

**Introduction**
- This personal wikipedia is meant to be an interface for learning, organization & storage of resources, and a final distillation of my medical knowledge. It is updated daily with what I learn from my colleagues, my patients, textbooks, anki, Amboss, UWorld, and UpToDate. There is a skeleton structure for the notes via wikilinks, however, the vault is meant to be searched. 
- There are different kinds of notes as well: topic notes and flashcards. A topic note will usually include a quiz of clickable cloze deletion questions, flashcards to cram, and my notes on the topic. Topic notes link to most of their related flashcards directly, but this is a structural feature and not meant to be how the cards are reviewed. Flashcards came directly from the Step 3 anki deck, which I've imported into markdown and saved to this vault. In other words, all the Step 3 anki cards were added here as separate these flashcard notes. These flashcards either have a random hash code in front (imported but not reformatted by me) of them, or start with the tilda ~ symbol (properly formatted by me). This is to easily separate the cards as I process them, in addition to the tags #review/card vs #review/topicnote. All together this allows us to review just topic notes, just flashcards, or a mix of both randomly. Please see the [[100 - Spaced Repetition|Spaced Repetition]] page for this feature and more.
