# Acid Base
## Summary
![](5544.png)
## History & Physical
## Diagnosis
**3 Important Considerations**
- Is the primary disorder acute vs. chronic?
- Is the primary disorder appropriately compensated?
- If not appropriately compensated, what additional process is present?
  
**3 Step Kupin Method**

**Acid Base Analysis – Quick and Basic**
1) Determine if pt is acidemic or alkalemic (check pH)
2) Determine if it is a 1o respiratory or metabolic abnormality (check PaCO2 and bicarb)
3) If respiratory, determine if pH correlates with respiratory status vs
   there is a metabolic abnormality (pH changes 0.08 for every inverse change of 10 in PaCO2)
4) If metabolic acidosis, determine if is high or normal anion gap (calculate anion gap)
5) Determine if there is a problem with oxygenation (calculate Aa gradient)

**Effects of Respiratory Disturbances on pH**:
- pH changes 0.08 for every inverse change of 10 in PaCO2
	- Anion Gap:  Na – (Cl+NaHCO3)
	- Aa Gradient:
		-  = (760-47)*0.21 – (PaO2 + PaCO2/0.8) 
		- OR = 150 – (PaO2 + PaCO2 + 0.25*PaCO2)

**Principles**:
- Always consider the clinical situation
- Anticipate the likely abnormalities
- “Compensation” refers to the pulmonary or renal attempts to bring the pH back to normal
- “Compensation” alone will NEVER return the pH to “normal”
- Do not refer to the “expected” attempts at compensation as primary acid-base disturbances
- If the pH is normal, and the PaCO2 is not normal, there must be at least 2 acid-base primary disturbances
                pH changes 0.08 for every inverse change of 10 in PaCO2

         Anion Gap:  Na – (Cl+NaHCO3)

         Aa Gradient = (760-47)*0.21 – (PaO2 + PaCO2/0.8)

                        OR

                 = 150 – (PaO2 + PaCO2 + 0.25*PaCO2)

Principles:

• Always consider the clinical situation

• Anticipate the likely abnormalities

• “Compensation” refers to the pulmonary or renal attempts
to bring the pH back to normal

• “Compensation” alone will NEVER return the pH to “normal”

• Do not refer to the “expected” attempts at compensation as
primary acid-base disturbances

• If the pH is normal, and the PaCO2 is not normal,
there must be at least 2 acid-base primary disturbances
